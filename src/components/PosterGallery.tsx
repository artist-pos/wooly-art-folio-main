After nearly four years inside @Woolworths, yesterday was my final day. This is not a metaphor. It is a testament to the systematic rot within the stores.

It begins with the calculated breaking of bodies.

A colleague was threatened with firing for a back injury. Months later, I wrecked my own back moving tonnes of produce. The manager buried the report.

For years, I was the engine of a liquor department, building the best in Auckland. But I was locked into a 15-hour contract, consistently working 60-hour weeks.

This was not dedication; it was exploitation.

This is the system: the moment my hours approached the material threshold that would necessitate a full-time contract, they were systematically slashed. Mine, and others'. This is a deliberate, widespread strategy to deny workers permanent status and the security that comes with it.

The reward for my loyalty? This January, a slipped disc left me bedridden, unable to carry my child.

When I returned, I was branded "unreliable."

The culture is poisoned by protected misconduct and nepotism.

A senior Union Rep—a man who used racial slurs, bullied and harassed numerous staff (including teenage after-school workers), and engaged in recurring theft for over three years—was not fired. He was protected. The investigations were buried.

This is the standard: cruelty and corruption are tolerated if you're in the right circle.

Meanwhile, a system of cultural nepotism dictates everything.

Jobs are never publicly listed. When hours are freed up, they are reserved for the next family or clique hire. Promotions are whispered, not earned.

I was systematically sidelined from professional development: forbidden from corresponding with merchandisers, blocked from phone calls that were routine for others. This is a deliberate strategy to limit our growth and maintain a controllable in-group.

The gaslighting is the glue.

Health and Safety is a sick joke. Our safety documents were not just ignored—they were pre-forged. We were given the forms with the answers already filled in, a fraudulent checkbox exercise designed to protect the company, not the workers.

A manager would come to work drunk, disappear for Uber Eats runs, then scream at us to work faster.

After a "restructure," I was demoted and ordered to train the very people who replaced me. When I refused, I was screamed at in front of customers and suppliers: "You never taught anyone anyway."

They break you, then blame you for the pieces.

This is the Woolworths way.

Exploit. Injure. Gaslight. Discard.

My 'Woolworst' poster is my testimony—the visual proof of their poison. I have a platform. This is for the hundreds who don't. For everyone who has been told their pain isn't real and their voice doesn't count.`
